# LAP 4 Futureproof Final Project

## Introduction

We are `The Concept Crew` and this project is part of futureproofs 13-week bootcamp for the 4th Lap. The task was to design and develop a full stack app using React for the front-end and Flask for the back-end.

Our app is named **WeSwap**, a clothing recycle app which lets users take unwanted items of clothing, post them. Once posted, the usser is able to make offers to other users for their clothing item. When both parties have mutually agreed liked eachothers clothing item and found a match, they can communicate with eachother, meetup, and complete the swap.

## Pre-requisites

A minimum of [Node v16.11.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) needs to be installed

## Installing

After git cloning this repository, CD into the directory, `fp-final-project-front-end`, and run the following command to install all the dependencies:

```
$ npm i
```

After the dependencies are installed, the app is ready to be launched

## Launching the App

To start the app, run the following command:

```
$ npm start
```

## Testing

For testing, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) has been implemented. To run the test, execute the following command:

```
$ npm t
```

## Hosting

**WeSwap** is hosted on [Netlify](https://the-concept-crew.netlify.app/home) and available to use.
The back-end code for **WeSwap** can be found [here](https://github.com/sigltech/fp-final-project-back-end)

## Improvements

Given the scope and timeline of the project, we were not able to implement many features we had in mind. If the scope of the project allowed it, we would add the following improvements to **WeSwap**:

- Ability for the user to add multiple images of the same posting
- Implement user account settings page
- Ability for users to make counter offers with a different piece of clothing they own instead of the one that was chosen by the offer maker
